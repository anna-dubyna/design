    <h3>What is minimalism </h3>
    <div>
        <p class="second">Minimalism isn't just about throwing everything away and leaving white walls.<br>
           It is a mindset that allows you to take everything you need for a happy life, <br> but not more. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="second-part">Not at the cost of air pollution, not at the cost of landfills, not at the cost of <br> lives of animals and fish, 
           which die because a person wants more and more.</p>
